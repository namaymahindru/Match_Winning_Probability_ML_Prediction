<p>This is a Machine Learning Project that uses Logistic Regression and/or Random Forest Classifier to predict the winning probability of the teams after the completion of first innings of the match.</p>
<p>I have used Pycharm ide to create a web app which incorporates the ML model build and uses it to predict the winning probability</p>
<p>Tech stack involved is python,streamlit and python.</p>
